		<p>The era has come when 12 film fans gather together serving for Film Society. They erect their ears with curiosity. They open their eyes for unlimited possibilities. They put their hearts to all friends sharing the same passion. They call themselves Marvel, the ones to bring about a change, a difference and a miracle.</p>
		<p>The cabinet has been formed after the rigid process of promotion period. Rookies are turning into masters. They are fully aware of the experience of their predecessors and moreover ready to pass on their spirit to facilitate the future improvement of this 20-year-old society.</p>
		<p>With great enthusiasm and a sense of responsibility, the newly formed task force is on its way to advancing the continuity and progress of Film Society. Their diverse talents and tremendous passion are ready to be contributed whenever needed. The art of films and the fun within it will be spread across HKUST through their endless efforts. Love for films and ambitions for a brighter future will fuel them along the way. The battle is sure to be tough yet joyful, to make Film Society one of the best in whichever categories.</p>
		<p>We live our life a-quarter-mile at a time. Nothing else matters. But the year to be in Marvel, we are free.</p>
		<p>Let’s set the world on fire with passion and faith!</p>
